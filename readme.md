- Built an Android Application for the safety of train passengers during the COVID Pandemic
- Forecasting of the passenger workload on the basis of time, train schedule, etc.
- Platform occupancy level predictor
- Train compartment live status prediction
- Tried different forecasting models to achieve an R<sup>2</sup> score of 0.7 and above. This can be further improved by the addition of weather as well as live tracking APIs. We can also apply NLP techniques like Sentiment Analysis as well as Semantic Parsing to get to know of any anomaly at a station in case of any issue.
- Used various Azure services like Azure functions, Azure Databricks, Azure Data Lake to apply in the backend to help process the data required for the application.
